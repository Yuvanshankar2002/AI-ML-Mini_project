#IMAGE RECOGNITION OF COUNTRY CURRENCY USING SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE:
#SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE:
Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems. However, primarily, it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.

#IMAGE RECOGNITION OF COUNTRY CURRENCY:
##INTRODUCTION:
           There are approximately 200+ currencies all over the world, with each of them looking totally different.  
            For instance the size of the paper is different, the same as the colour and pattern. 
            In this present times the business between countries has increased.
            The staffs who work for the money exchanging (e.g. Forex Bank) have to distinguish different types of currencies and that is not an easy job. 
             They have to remember the symbol of each currency. This may cause some problems (e.g. wrong recognition), so they need an efficient and exact system to help their work.
           After studying different currencies and considering the availability, we have chosen 3 currencies to work on for this project. The chosen currencies of countries are china,Indonesia and
Norway
            Here comes the challenge. So, to recognize the currency we need an efficient computerized and automated system
#PROBLEM STATEMENT:
            People face the problem of not being able to recognize the paper currency due to similarity of paper texture between the different categories. 
             These people face a lot of difficulty in their money transactions. In order to find a solution to this problem, we need to develop a technical solution which is cost effective and efficient to use for people
#EXPLANATION ABOUT THE PROCESS:
                 An image recognition algorithm takes an image ( or a patch of an image ) as input and outputs what the image contains.
       1. Classification of the image to a single category /multiple categories.
       2. Identification  of certain objects in an image
                  Based  on image resolution it will see height*width*dimension
                  In this image recognition system, we use numpy  , pandas library with ndarray to set and modify pixel values, trim images, concatenate images, and many more.
                  In this example, a scanner is used to acquire the image. The acquired image of a paper currency is first converted in to gray scaled image conversion to facilitates further pre-processing.

                   The task of pre-processing is achieved by converting coloured currency images to gray scale,then black-white image

#CONCLUSION:
           In this project, we actually worked on certain modules of the system which helps for currency recognition. 
           Each country has its own different currency so it is a very difficult task for people to recognize the currency. 
            In manual currency recognition system, there are many problems. We will be developing this system to overcome those problems which have been faced. And it was found that proposed algorithm has solved the major issues related to currency recognition.
           One of the initial feature of this system is obtaining the image and it basically focuses on an image that can be obtained by using number of different equipment’s, such as cameras or Scanner. 
            One approach is basically based on conversion of RGB value into HSV value and we also maintain the distance of each image by calculating Euclidean distance formula and then compare the distance with test image which give accurate result

Conversion to gray scale facilitates further pre-processing. 
The task ofpre-processing is achieved by converting colored currency images into grayscale, then black-white images. After 
that, the edge of the image is filtered using Prewitt method. Then, the image edge is detected using Canny’s edge 
detection method. Different stages of an image are shown
